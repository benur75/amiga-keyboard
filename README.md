# Mechanical Replacement Keyboard for Amiga 500 and 1200

Many years ago I got an Amiga 500 with missing keyboard. Since then original keyboards became so expensive, that custom mechanical keyboards can be built for the price of an original.
Unfortunately, Amiga-style Cherry MX keycaps are unavailable, so I used DSA profile blank keycaps.

## Known bugs

Revision A was a failure, as the position of many keys was inaccurate. Revision B seems good so far -- maybe a little bit of fileing needed here and there, for the best fit. Also, the positions of the LEDs are not accurate for the original LEDs.

The firmware is not finished yet -- it works for most of the time, but it's not perfect.

## Tools used

* Altium Designer 2011
* IAR Embedded Workbench for STM8 1.40.1
